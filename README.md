Our project explored the voting records of Georgia's elected representatives (Senators and house members). We gathered the voting records of each representative from the current year's Congress. A map of Georgia's different congressional distracts and a web page with an interactive menu were created. When a congressional member is selected, it will display metrics such as how many bills they have passed, to what degree they vote along party lines, the category of bills they have proposed, and so on and so forth. We also displayed some general demographic data for Georgia's voting population.

We used Jupyter Notebook to make API calls to ProPublica to gather the voting data, store the data into an SQLite database and then display the data with Javascript via Flask. Our dataset has the voting history of Georgia's representatives, which comprises well over 100 data points. JavaScript libraries we made use of are D3, Plotly, Canvas.js, and Leaflet.
